# Vision

Plants are cool. We should make more of them, and give people the tools to do that also.

## What is a TinyFarm

Think tinyhomes, but like, for farms and stuff.

## What are we doing?

Were trying to do some stuff.

* set up a tinyfarm in a shipping container
* try out components in standardized test environments
* build tools for simulation of tinyfarms
