# Vision

Plants are cool. We should make more of them, and give people the tools to do that also.

## What is a TinyFarm
Welcome to the TinyFarm community. We are a community dedicated to building and sharing designs to support the future of decentralized agriculture. We're just starting, so the vision is just beginning to take shape. In general we want to build tools to help people experiment with modular farm builds. Modules designs should be open and easy to build, and should ultimately snap together into a structure similar to a 20x8x8.5 foot shipping container. We want to build the tools to help people design and ultimately sell components, modules, and maybe even fully built out shipping container farms to people who are interested in operating them. This also means builting tools for simulating tinyfarms, which would ideally be fully autonomous machines where common supplies are used as input, and fully packaged food goods are the output. Once standardized, these units could be rapidly deployed to areas that have recently suffered natural disasters, or areas where farming has historically been difficult.

## What are we doing?

Were trying to do some stuff.

* set up a tinyfarm in a shipping container
* try out components in standardized test environments
* build tools for simulation of tinyfarms
